# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Akasha is an early-stage project with minimal codebase currently containing only documentation files. The repository contains:

- README.md: Basic project header
- vision.md: Project vision/planning document (untracked)

## Current State

This is a new repository with only documentation files present. No code, build tools, or development infrastructure has been established yet.

## Development Setup

No development commands or build processes are currently configured. Future development will require:

- Selecting and configuring appropriate technology stack
- Setting up build and development tooling
- Establishing testing framework
- Implementing project architecture

## Notes for Future Development

- The repository is initialized but contains no source code
- No package.json, configuration files, or development dependencies exist
- Technology stack and architecture decisions are pending
- Development workflow and tooling need to be established
