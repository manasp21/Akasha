**Visionary Plan: Advanced Modular Local RAG System (Text + Images)**

**1. Modular Architecture**
- **Principle:** All components remain independent and easily replaceable, supporting fully local operation and future expansion.
- **Main Modules:** Ingestion & Indexing, Multimodal Embedding & Storage, Multimodal Search & Generation.

**2. Ingestion & Indexing**
- **Goal:** Accept diverse research material—PDFs, scanned documents, supplementary image files, etc.
- **Design:** The system scans, parses, and segments research papers into text blocks, tables, figure captions, images, and diagrams. Each segment is tagged with its content type and relevant metadata (location in paper, figure number, caption text).

**3. Multimodal Embedding & Storage**
- **Goal:** Enable users to select a local embedding model capable of handling both images and text (multimodal).
- **Multimodal Embedding:** The chosen model processes both:
    - **Text:** Abstract, body, tables, figure captions.
    - **Images:** Figures, charts, diagrams, etc.
  Each content block—regardless of type—is embedded into a unified vector space, so that semantic connections between related text and images can be leveraged.
- **Vector Index:** Every vector is stored locally, with links to the original source and segment type for contextual retrieval.

**4. Multimodal Search & Retrieval**
- **Flexible Queries:** The system allows natural language questions, image-based queries (e.g., “find papers with plots like this”), or mixed modes.
- **Contextual Retrieval:** When queried, both text and image-based fragments are retrieved if they are semantically relevant—so a text query can bring up key images, and vice versa.
- **Research Paper Context:** The system maintains context, such as showing which figure, table, or paragraph a result fragment came from—supporting deep literature insight.

**5. Answer Generation**
- **Custom LLM choice:** For final responses, users can select a LLM that synthesizes answers using the retrieved multimodal evidence.
- **Input Flexibility:** The LLM can be prompted with snippets of text, textual descriptions of images, and references to visuals for richer, more accurate output.

**6. Workflow Customization**
- **Fine-tuning:** Advanced users may fine-tune retrieval and embedding logic, prioritizing either text or image features as needed for their use cases.
- **Pipeline Control:** All steps—ingestion, multimodal embedding, retrieval, and generation—are modular and user-configurable throughout.

**7. Local-First, Privacy-Respecting**
- **Everything On-Device:** All parsing, embedding (including image models), and generation happen on local hardware—no data leaves the user’s machine.
- **Data Security:** All research content, embeddings, and usage logs are private and under user control.

**8. User Experience Vision**
- **Research-Oriented GUI:** A visualization interface to explore papers, query by topic, or search for visually similar diagrams/figures.
- **History/Traceability:** Clear links for every answer showing which paper, section, or figure provided supporting evidence.
- **Transparency & Control:** Users always see which models process which data, and can change configurations effortlessly.

**9. Extensibility**
- **Multimodal Plugin API:** New embedding models and data segmenters can be added through a plugin system—supporting future document types, new image formats, and more.
- **Community Modules:** Advanced retrieval tools, OCR engines, PDF parsers, and document structurers can be contributed and swapped.

**In summary:**  
Envision a **local RAG platform built for research**, with full multimodal capability—a system that deeply understands and indexes both text and images from dense documents like research papers. It allows detailed, context-rich retrieval, supporting publishers, academics, and technical professionals who need to interact with both the language and the visuals of modern science, all while preserving privacy and total user control.
